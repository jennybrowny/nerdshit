// [TO DO 7/22, 3-5 Hours]
// - Introduction ACT 0?
// - Background sprite of bedroom with storytime spirtes to introduce the player to the game

// realistic: base min is you get up to Dr. Choi 

// note to self: focus on above ^^ --- everything else future me problem
// use your resources, touch grass, balance but remember

// 7/22 2 PM - 4:52 PM
// Wins: 
// Refined used of classes: game, button (button looks great!)
// Composition added: game contains button
// Design patterns: use of statepatterns (start_screen, tutorial_Screen)
// added sound onto start screen, buttons yay!
//---
// to do: the remaining issues are primarily API fixes and path validation. 
// Gaps: still no inheritance (need screen class, ADD)
// probably why tutorial is being whack
// note to self: youʻre building a solid foundation of the core mechinanics now itʻs girlypoppifying it
// you see the vision, you see the end goal, you see the light at the end of the tunnel. DO IT.
