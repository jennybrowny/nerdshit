// Nerdshit log of edits cause I canʻt remember shit
// used Replit, Deepseek

// ----------------------------------------
// 7/21: 7 PM - 10 PM 
// Wins: 
// Game fucking compiles HOLY LEE SHIT AFTER THREE FUCKING WEEKS
// Window is created (thanks Herve)
// Window can upload a background image of nerd central
// Start button created to go to introduction 

// [TO DO 7/22, 3-5 Hours]
// - Introduction ACT 0?
// - Background sprite of bedroom with storytime spirtes to introduce the player to the game
// - Dr. Song Choi sprite with his dialouge sprite because textboxes look P.O.O.R!
// - Transitions to ACT 1: Mangoman ECE160  [ideal]
// realistic: base min is you get up to Dr. Choi 

// note to self: focus on above ^^ --- everything else future me problem
// use your resources, touch grass, balance but remember
// youʻve wrote a grant in 4 days... and got funded (fuck you Dutra you almost fucked me over)... 
// you AI your way through your x496 with min help from Dr. Paul Schmiit Ph.D and you know what he said?
// "I believe in you" (just like Herve) but ngl he just didnʻt want to look at your code cause it was "spagghetti code" 
// but you did it anyways and YOU CAN DO IT AGAIN!

// ----------------------------------------
// 7/22 2 PM - 4:52 PM
// Wins: 
// Refined used of classes: game, button (button looks great!)
// Composition added: game contains button
// Design patterns: use of statepatterns (start_screen, tutorial_Screen)
// added sound onto start screen, buttons yay!
//---
// to do: the remaining issues are primarily API fixes and path validation. 
// Gaps: still no inheritance (need screen class, ADD)
// probably why tutorial is being whack
// note to self: youʻre building a solid foundation of the core mechinanics now itʻs girlypoppifying it
// you see the vision, you see the end goal, you see the light at the end of the tunnel. DO IT.

// 7/22  7PM - 10:43 PM | Gaps: still no inheritance (need screen class, ADD)
// Wins: 
// - BROKE THE FUCKING GAME but then got it to work again but lesser... loaded it back up
// - making progress on button inhertiance! Woot woot, like had to strip it but itʻs worth a decent chunk of points
//---
// GAPS OKAY SOME HOW I REMOVED THE FUCKING SOUND FROM BUTTONS 2 steps back one step forward
// - Need to fix sound on button click but make it an good damn inhertiance class 
// - start on report and ACT I NOW get those pages going! Throw that shit into GPT 
//    - find out how to structure ACT 0 intsro rubric using design patterns 
//    - Another button... 
//    - put a pin on the button sound just get through Act 0 
// NEXT STEPS: ACT 0 
// go to game.cpp, your goal is to get one turtoial sprite on the screen (ACT1_01.PNG)
// scaling must likely the issue, solve it and have it fit in termial
// you tried manually saving it as a PNG to exact dimensions of the window but frankly looks like you auto scale it anyways
// note to self: add sound to buttons but eh not as important as going to act 0 and having the player click through sprites
// ----------------------------------------
// 7/23 - 7/24 FINISH ACT 0 -- sike bitch
/*
this is bullSHIT havenʻt finished ACT0 because the spirites are not loading
going through each debug for classes and got overwhelmed 
// ----------------------------------------
*/
/* 7/24 10am - 11:30am 
handling button class, debugging went from 12 errors to 6
- how i was calling in the text HAS AN ORDER
- calling in a sound first when I didnʻt tell the header that it exists
tl;dr basically im calling in shit without even considering the order or the bigger picture also my code 
is so fucking spaggitti that instead of adding on and pushing through to finish ACT0 Iʻm backtracking to better understand
what each class does so it doesnʻt fuck me up when Iʻm building on top of it
*/
/*
// ----------------------------------------
7/26 7pm - 9:33pm
fixing button class turns out i fucked it up, the code works but my class for button doesnʻt 20+
errors. FUCK.
